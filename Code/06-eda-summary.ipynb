    "    <li>🔹 <b>Demographic and Personal Features</b>: Age, Race, and Gender provide essential demographic context and may reflect health disparities across groups.</li>\n",
    "    <li>🔹 <b>Hospitalization Metrics</b>: Time in Hospital, Number of Lab Procedures, Number of Medications, and Number of Diagnoses correlate with readmission, capturing complexity in patient care.</li>\n",
    "    <li>🔹 <b>Visit and Procedure Counts</b>: Number of Inpatient and Outpatient Visits offer additional context on healthcare utilization, potentially reflecting chronic conditions or recurring health concerns.</li>\n",

    "<b>Conclusion:</b> The EDA indicates that factors such as admission type, source, discharge status, hospitalization duration, number of diagnoses, and medications are significant in predicting readmission risk. Modeling should prioritize these features to capture the complexities of patient readmission, while demographic variables like race and age offer additional context for disparities in healthcare outcomes.\n",
